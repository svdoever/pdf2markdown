## Climate change and the city

Cities are big contributors to climate change – not so surprising, since that is where around 75% of Europeans live today. As hubs of activity, they are a big source of emissions. Urban areas account for 60-80% of global energy use and around the same share of CO₂ emissions, so they have a large carbon footprint. Urban areas are also particularly vulnerable to the inevitable and increasing adverse impacts of climate change, such as floods, heat waves, coastal erosion and forest fires. For instance, the higher proportion of artificial and impervious surfaces in urban areas prevents excess rainwater from draining and storing heat. But as well as being part of the problem, cities can also be part of the solution. Cities across the EU are changing for the better, thanks to the innovation and vision of local leaders who are helping reduce emissions and adapt to climate change impacts through smart planning and clever schemes.

The EU aims to cut emissions from transport by at least 60% by 2050.

## Accessible cities

Car-free days are a great way of exploring alternative ways of getting around town. This is one of the events that takes place in many cities during European Mobility Week, a campaign supported by the European Commission which is organised every September. In 2016, more than 2,400 cities from over 50 countries took part. And despite the title, cities outside the EU also participated – including some in Japan, Argentina, Mali and Mexico. Mobility Week gives people the chance to try out alternative forms of transport and encourages cities to introduce practical measures. More than 8,000 permanent measures, such as carpooling and bicycle-sharing schemes, have been introduced thanks to the campaign.

Cities cover around 2x of the Earth's surface but are home to more than half the world's population.

## Mayors with a mission

Cities across Europe have made a voluntary commitment to take measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prepare for the impacts of climate change. They have joined the Covenant of Mayors, a European Commission scheme to encourage cities to cut emissions and adapt to climate change. Cities are increasing energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy sources and sustainable transport, as well as 'climate-proofing' infrastructure, developing urban green areas and adapting civil protection, amongst other initiatives. In 2016, the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy was launched to accelerate climate action at local level all over the world. Now over 7,000 cities from 119 countries and 6 continents are working together for the climate. Is your city – or the city closest to you – on board?

### TOP TIP
New cars sold in EU countries have a label showing their fuel efficiency and CO₂ emissions, so help your family choose a car with low fuel consumption.
