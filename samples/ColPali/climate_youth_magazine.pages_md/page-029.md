## Carbon offsetting

Carbon offsetting is when you calculate the amount of carbon an activity – for example a long-distance plane ride – releases and then pay an organisation to reduce emissions elsewhere, or in some cases plant trees. It sounds good, but some people say it is better to try harder to create less carbon in the first place. What do you think?

## Young Europeans lead the way

### Why not turn the climate challenge into a fun competition at school?
Ask your teachers about organising a league, in which the most climate-friendly class or group wins a prize.

Here are a few ideas: 
- planting a school garden
- litterless lunches
- a ‘cycle to school’ campaign
- a book swap.

Did you know that you can recreate the greenhouse effect with just a glass jar and two thermometers?

## Speak up!

### Why not get involved yourself?
You might come up with an idea that could change the future!

Get your arguments ready and join the debate at school and at home. And if you feel passionate enough, why not start campaigning for climate action?

- Talk about the issues with friends and family and get them involved. You will be able to explain the topics to them in a way that really makes an impact – and showing them how much you care may make them care more, too.
- Encourage your family to make changes at home and in their daily lives.
- Find out what climate actions your school is taking.
- Write to mayors, politicians and business leaders to encourage them to take action.

## And remember these two things:
1. It is not too late to fix the climate.
2. You can make a difference – we all can!
