## Protecting global forests

A scheme called REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation plus conservation) helps tropical countries adopt more sustainable practices by paying people in developing countries to preserve their forests. It does this by calculating the value of carbon prevented from entering the atmosphere by not cutting them down, and converts this into funds for climate-smart use of forest land. 

REDD+ money has been used in more than 40 countries, for example, on forest monitoring (measuring trees), improving fire-service response to forest fires, and developing the agroforestry industry (a mix of farming and forestry). It is a careful balancing act between conservation and protecting the interests of those who live in and rely on the forest for food, water, and other resources. EU member states and institutions have so far contributed over €1 billion to activities related to REDD+ in Africa, Asia and Latin America.

Soils are home to over a quarter of all living species on Earth.

## Soil’s super carbon store

Most of us consider the soil beneath our feet as just dirt, but it plays an essential role in regulating the world’s climate. Soil stores carbon, mainly in the form of organic matter, and is the second largest carbon pool on Earth, after the oceans. It is estimated that 0.1% of the carbon currently stored in European soils is the equivalent of the annual emissions from as many as 100 million cars.

The ability of soil to keep hold of the huge amounts of carbon it stores has been weakened in recent decades, largely due to unsustainable land management practices and changes in land use. However, good forestry practices and good land management can help maintain or even increase the amount of carbon held in the ground.
