## Fighting climate change  
### around the world

Global efforts to fight climate change really began in 1992, when countries around the world signed an international treaty called the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

### World unites for climate action

Our planet cannot be saved unless we leave fossil fuels in the ground where they belong. An upheaval and massive change is required, now. One that leads to a new collective consciousness. A new collective evolution of the human race, inspired and enabled by a sense of urgency from all of you. We all know that reversing the course of climate change will not be easy, but the tools are in our hands – if we apply them before it is too late. 

Some countries, including all EU Member States, adopted legally-binding targets to limit greenhouse gas emissions in the years up to 2020, under an agreement called the Kyoto Protocol. But even with pledges from other countries to take voluntary action, this was not going to be enough to avoid dangerous climate change.

So negotiations were held on a new agreement that would require action by all countries round the world – and on 12 December 2015 in Paris, France, almost 200 governments agreed on the first ever universal, legally-binding deal on climate change.

The historic Paris Agreement sets out an action plan to limit global warming to less than 2°C above the temperature of pre-industrial times. Governments also agreed to try to limit the global temperature rise to maximum 1.5°C, as scientists around the world agreed that this would significantly reduce risks and impacts of climate change. The Agreement’s other key point is to strengthen the ability of countries, especially less developed ones, to deal with impacts that do occur.

But citizens and businesses have an important role to play, too. All round the world, cities and towns, companies, investors and individuals are already taking action to help keep our climate safe and predictable.
