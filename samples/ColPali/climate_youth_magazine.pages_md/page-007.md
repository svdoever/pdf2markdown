## The carbon cycle: always on the move

Carbon is everywhere and in all living things – including you! But carbon does not stay in one place – it is constantly moving from one part of the planet to another and changing form. For example, carbon exists in the air mainly as a gas (carbon dioxide, or CO₂) which is absorbed by plants, including trees, and the oceans.

On land, animals, including us, take in carbon when they eat plants and breathe it out during respiration. When plants and animals die, their remains decay and decompose, creating carbon which is absorbed back into the Earth. The carbon cycle has kept the proportion of the gas in the atmosphere more or less stable for thousands of years.

However, this fine balance is being upset by human activities that either release CO₂ faster than it can be removed naturally, or reduce natural stores of carbon such as through deforestation of tropical rainforests. This increases the amount of CO₂ in the atmosphere, and because CO₂ is a greenhouse gas, this causes the Earth's temperature to increase.

## Did you know?

Without the greenhouse effect, the average temperature on Earth would be a chilly -18°C instead of the comfortable 15°C it is today – far too cold for plants and animals, including us, to survive!

## Is the hole in the ozone layer responsible for climate change?

No! Ozone is a very useful gas high up in the Earth’s atmosphere that absorbs harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun. When scientists realised that man-made gases used in fridges and aerosols were making a hole in the ozone layer, the international community set about phasing them out. An agreement called the Montreal Protocol was drawn up to gradually reduce the use of these dangerous substances called chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).

Efforts have been so successful that the ozone layer is on track to recover by the middle of the 21st century. Unfortunately, the CFCs – and their successor substances – were eventually replaced by fluorinated gases, known as F-gases. These have no effect on the ozone layer but are powerful greenhouse gases. Once again, the world is taking action: in October 2016, the 195 countries that signed the Montreal Protocol agreed to limit their use of these harmful gases. The EU is now leading the world in restricting their use and finding alternatives to them. By 2030, EU emissions of F-gases will be cut by two-thirds compared to 2014 levels.

## Did you know?

Fossil fuels – like coal – are the remains of ancient plants and animals buried deep in the ground for millions of years that have turned into substances that can be used as fuels.

## Did you know?

Did you know that the European Union has its own satellite programme for observing the Earth?

It’s called Copernicus and it’s the most advanced system in the world for monitoring the planet. Copernicus is made up of six families of satellites – of land and sea. The images can be used by anyone, for free, for many purposes including tracking changes in the climate and environment.
