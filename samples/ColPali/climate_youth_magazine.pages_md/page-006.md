## The science bit

Earth's climate has changed throughout history, gradually getting hotter or colder for long periods of time. In the last million years there have been about 10 ice ages, with much warmer periods in between. These changes were the result of natural causes, such as changes in the tilt of the planet, the sun’s activity and ocean currents. But the changes we are seeing today are different – and we are responsible! By releasing more of the gases that trap heat into the atmosphere, we are causing the temperature on Earth to rise very quickly.

## The greenhouse effect

When sunlight hits the Earth’s surface, some of this energy is absorbed and warms the ground and the oceans. The rest of the energy can escape back into space, but some of it is trapped in the atmosphere and warms the Earth. This is called the ‘greenhouse effect’, because the atmosphere acts like the glass in a greenhouse – warming the inside. This greenhouse effect happens because the Earth’s atmosphere contains gases such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide (these are called greenhouse gases). The greenhouse effect is what normally keeps our planet at a comfortable temperature. However, human activities are increasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere which makes the greenhouse effect stronger and increases the temperature of the Earth.

### Did you know?

Levels of carbon dioxide (CO₂) in the atmosphere are higher today than at any time during the last 800,000 years.

## What’s causing climate change?

Climate change is caused by the increase in the Earth’s temperature (global warming) which comes from adding more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere than those occurring naturally. These extra greenhouse gases mainly come from burning fossil fuels to produce energy, as well as from other human activities like cutting down rainforests, agriculture, farming livestock and the production of chemicals.

## Weather vs. climate

Weather and climate are different but related things. Weather describes the day-to-day conditions in a particular place – for example, it can be cloudy and wet one day and sunny the next. ‘Climate’ describes the average weather conditions in a place over relatively long periods of time (e.g. 30 years). Deserts, for example, have a hot and dry climate, while the Arctic and Antarctic regions are cold and dry.

## Getting warmer

In 2016, the Earth was around 1.1°C hotter than it was in the late 19th century – and the average global temperature is set to rise even more over the next century. 1.1°C may not sound like much, but consider this:

- Most of the warming so far happened in the past few decades, so the temperature rise is speeding up.  
- Don’t forget, this is an average increase: some places have become much warmer and others colder. For example, the Arctic has become substantially warmer over the last 60 years and could be ice-free in summer by 2040. Europe is warming faster than other areas of the world.  
- According to some studies, Earth's temperature during the last ice age was only around 4°C colder than in the late 19th century.
