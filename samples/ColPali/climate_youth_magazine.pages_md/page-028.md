## Over to you!

What about you? Do you feel concerned about the threats from climate change? Are you passionate about the need to reduce carbon emissions? A good place to start is by making changes in everyday actions that reduce your carbon footprint. No action you take is too small.

### Did you know?
The average carbon footprint of a European is nearly 7 tonnes of CO₂ a year.

## Make smart choices

One way you can make a difference is by making smart choices.

- **Cleaner transport:** Walk, cycle or use public transport whenever possible. Try to avoid flying if you can.
  
- **Smarter energy use:** Don’t heat rooms more than necessary. Use energy-efficient light bulbs.
  
- **A green diet:** Eating plenty of fruit and vegetables and less meat is climate-friendly and healthy too. Avoid eating too much beef. Try not to waste food.

- **Be picky about packaging:** Plastic packaging creates a lot of waste and is often difficult to recycle. Try to avoid packaged products and take a reusable bag to carry your shopping home.

### TOP TIPS
- Leaving a TV or computer on standby mode still uses up some energy. So does plugging in your mobile phone overnight – and even when your charger isn't connected to your phone, it’s draining electricity! Switching off and unplugging devices can reduce your house’s annual energy costs by as much as 10%.

- Turning down the thermostat by 1°C could reduce your family’s energy bill by 10% – and setting a lower temperature at night and when you’re out of the house will lower the bill even more.

- Turn off the tap while brushing your teeth – this will save many litres of water. Also, did you know that taking a shower instead of a bath uses up to four times less energy, as well as much less water?
