## Milestones

- **1988**  
  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is created, bringing together thousands of scientists to assess scientific evidence on climate change and its impacts.

- **1992**  
  Almost all countries in the world join the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the main international treaty for fighting climate change.

- **1997**  
  The UNFCCC adopts the Kyoto Protocol, the world's first greenhouse gas emissions treaty.

- **2005**  
  The EU launches its Emissions Trading System (see page 20).

- **2007**  
  The EU adopts its 2020 climate and energy package, with three key targets: reduce EU greenhouse gas emissions by 20% compared to 1990; increase the share of renewables to 20% of EU energy use; and improve energy efficiency by 20%.

- **2009**  
  A UN climate change conference in Copenhagen ends without an overall agreement on binding emissions cuts.

- **2014**  
  100 world leaders meet for a UN climate summit in New York; the IPCC's 5th Assessment Report on climate change declares that the below 2°C objective is still within reach; the EU adopts its 2030 climate and energy package, including a target to reduce EU greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% compared to 1990.

- **2015**  
  A new global climate treaty – the Paris Agreement – is agreed. 195 countries commit to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, to limit the increase in global temperature to well below 2°C above pre-Industrial levels.

- **2016**  
  The Paris Agreement enters into force on 4 November 2016.

## Did you know?  
In 2016, the EU was responsible for less than 10% of global CO2 emissions, while China accounted for around 29% and the US 14%.

## A sign of global commitment  
On 22 April 2016, 174 countries formally signed the Paris Agreement in New York - by far the largest number of countries ever to sign an international treaty on a single day. For the Paris Agreement to become law, at least 55 countries representing at least 55% of global emissions had to formally ratify it. The EU formally ratified the deal on 5 October 2016, triggering its entry into force on 4 November, less than a year after it was adopted.

## Funding change  
Poorer and more vulnerable nations need help cutting their emissions and adapting to the impacts of climate change. The EU provides the largest amount of public money to developing countries to fund climate projects. In 2016, for example, the EU and its member countries collectively provided €20.2 billion to help them tackle climate change. EU Member States also contributed almost half of the $10 billion pledged to the UN's new Green Climate Fund, which is also supporting developing countries.
