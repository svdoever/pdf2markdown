## Did you know?
The city of Venice sank by more than 20 cm in the 20th century.

## Sinking city
The wooden piles on which Venice is built are disappearing into the mud in the shallow lagoon in the Adriatic Sea. With the lagoon waters rising by about 2 mm each year, the combined effect is a 4-mm-a-year rise in the sea level. Frequent floods damage the historic buildings, cover paths and affect tourism. However, a project is underway to install 78 huge steel gates to protect the city from floods up to 3 m. It should be completed in 2018. In addition to the gates, Venice will receive extra protection via the restoration of salt marshes, which act as natural barriers against sea level rise.

## Did you know?
Only 2.5% of water on Earth is fresh water. Of this, over two-thirds are frozen in glaciers and polar ice caps. So, use water wisely!

## Polar food threat
The largest polar predators, like leopard seals and polar bears, need tiny algae that grow on the underside of ice to survive. These algae are the start of almost all polar food chains. Plankton eat the algae, small fish and krill and other creatures eat the plankton, and so on up the food chain to fish, penguins and seals. With less Antarctic and Arctic sea ice, these food chains are breaking down.
