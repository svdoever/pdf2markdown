## Wild storms

Global warming is being linked to wilder, more damaging storms. Hurricanes, typhoons, and cyclones are different names for the violent storms that form over warm bodies of water, like the Pacific Ocean or Caribbean Sea, when there is a lot of warm, wet air in the atmosphere. On land, the fast, spiraling winds can uproot trees, destroy buildings and overturn vehicles.

### Did you know?

Between 1900 and 2015, over 30,000 natural disasters occurred worldwide, causing around €6 trillion worth of damage.

## Flood alert!

Heavy rain causes floods when it runs off land and swells rivers and reservoirs so they burst their banks. The impact can be extreme in cities, where water cannot soak into concrete and tarmac. After the flood waters have subsided, the clean-up is time-consuming and expensive.

In 2017, severe flooding in South Asia killed more than 1,000 people and forced millions from their homes.

## Wildlife on the move

Many land and sea species have already moved to new locations. Some will be at greater risk of extinction without action to limit climate change. Changes in the climate also mean that some insects that previously lived in one region are now invading new places. Some mosquitoes transmit diseases such as yellow fever, dengue fever, chikungunya, and malaria when they bite. Originally, these insects lived only in tropical places, but some live and breed in southern Europe today because the climate is warmer.
