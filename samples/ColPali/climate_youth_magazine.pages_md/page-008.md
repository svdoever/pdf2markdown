## Measuring change

Samples of ice taken from deep below Antarctica contain bubbles of air from 650,000 years ago. They tell us about greenhouse gas levels in the past, and reveal that concentrations of CO₂ and methane in the atmosphere were much lower than they are today.

### Tree rings

Tree rings are a record of a year’s growth. Scientists study rings in very old trees to find out how the climate has changed over time. For example, rings are thinner when the weather is cold or dry.

### The Mauna Loa Observatory

The Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, USA, has been measuring CO₂ levels in the atmosphere since 1958. Measurements taken from this remote location, where the air is undisturbed, are a good indicator of global CO₂ levels.

### Satellite images

Satellite images can be used to show changes in Arctic sea ice cover over a period of time.

## Well below 2°C

Governments have agreed that to prevent the most severe impacts of climate change, the increase in the global temperature must be limited to well below 2°C compared to the level in pre-industrial times (before the Industrial Revolution). This is because scientists believe that beyond this point the risk of irreversible large-scale changes increases dramatically. Countries have also agreed to try to limit warming to 1.5°C, as this would significantly reduce the risks and the impacts of climate change. These objectives were agreed under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) – the international agreement to address the climate challenge (see page 24).

## Sorting the science

Every 6 or 7 years, an important scientific body called the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) releases a report on scientific evidence on climate change. The world’s most influential and respected climate scientists contribute to this. They assess tens of thousands of scientific papers to update the world on the state of the climate plus options to tackle global warming and the changes it brings.

The IPCC’s most recent assessment report, published in stages in 2013 and 2014, involved thousands of authors and editors from more than 80 countries. The report shows there is at least a 95% certainty that human activities are the main cause of climate change. However, it also says that it is not too late to prevent dangerous climate change but the world must act fast to cut greenhouse gas emissions.

### TOP TIP

Get your parents to check the labels when they buy a new fridge or air-conditioning unit, to make sure they are energy efficient and are not harmful to the ozone layer.
