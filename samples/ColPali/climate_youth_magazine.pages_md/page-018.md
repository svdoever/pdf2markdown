## Driving change

What kinds of transport do you use? Cars, trains, buses, boats and planes that burn oil-based fuels are responsible for around a quarter of EU greenhouse gas emissions. Fortunately, new technologies are helping to make transport more climate-friendly. By reducing traffic and pollution, they are making our cities cleaner, too.

### On the road to cleaner transport

Over 70% of transport emissions in Europe come from road transport, but thanks to EU CO₂ emission standards, vehicles are becoming less polluting. The EU has some of the toughest standards in the world and is continuously working to strengthen them. For example, in 2021, CO₂ emission standards for new cars in the EU will be more than 20% stricter than in 2015. Many countries including the US, Canada, Japan and China have also introduced CO₂ standards.

#### Emissions from the global shipping industry

Emissions from the global shipping industry amount to around 1 billion tonnes of CO₂ a year, accounting for roughly 3% of the world's total greenhouse gas emissions. The EU has adopted laws for monitoring emissions from large ships using EU ports.

Over 90% of Europeans think climate change is a serious problem. What do people in your country think? Find out here: [EU Climate Citizens](https://ec.europa.eu/clima/citizens/support_en).

### Aviation

Aviation is one of the fastest-growing sources of greenhouse gas emissions. The EU has laws in place to reduce aviation emissions from all flights within Europe and is working with the international community to develop measures that cover the whole world.
