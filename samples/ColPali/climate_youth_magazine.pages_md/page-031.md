### How is climate change affecting your country?

### What are you doing to fight climate change?
I try to do my best in my daily life. I also take part in a group at school that is raising awareness of climate change, mainly among people in our school.

### How is climate change affecting your life?
One does not necessarily notice climate change, because it is not a concrete thing – one cannot hold it in their hand and say, “Here is climate change”.  
Climate change affects my life very much indeed. I think about it every day, especially how much energy I consume. Whenever I see an extra light on somewhere or bad rush hour traffic, I just wonder how all this could affect the future.

### What do you know about the causes of climate change?
Climate change happens because cars, planes, and other means of transport emit CO₂, and this CO₂ enters the Earth’s atmosphere.

### How is climate change affecting our planet?
The ice caps in the North and South Poles are melting because the planet is getting warmer. This brings fresh water into circulation, meaning small islands can be flooded.
