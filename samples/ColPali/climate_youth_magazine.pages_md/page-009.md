## Ask the scientist

### How serious is climate change?  
Our planet is warming fast. Human activities are causing this change and we are beginning to see the consequences all over the world. The more we disturb the climate, the greater the risks of dangerous changes and the harder and more expensive it will be to limit future changes and adapt to the unavoidable impacts. The average temperature of the Earth's surface could rise by 4°C or more above pre-industrial levels before the end of this century if we don’t take urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

### How does science help in the fight against climate change?  
Science is where it all starts. It helps us understand the changes we’re experiencing now and those that could happen in the future, depending on our actions today and over the coming decades. Science provides the solid evidence that guides policy-makers and enables them to make informed decisions on the best course of action.

### What can we do about climate change?  
Unfortunately, there will be some impacts of climate change that we won’t be able to avoid and we will have to adapt to those, but it’s still important that we limit the scale of future impacts. The good news is that there is a lot we can do. It’s not just up to politicians to take action. Businesses and industry, communities, and individuals also have a responsibility to act. As individual citizens, we can all do our part by making smart choices like eating less meat and more locally-grown fruit and vegetables, saving energy and cycling or walking instead of travelling by car (especially for short journeys). The great thing is that many of these actions are also good for our health and our wallets.

## WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?  
**Global warming** describes the current rise in the Earth’s temperature. It is just one feature of climate change.

**Climate change** refers to the many different effects of global warming on the Earth’s climate system. These include rising sea levels, melting glaciers, changing rainfall patterns, increased frequency of extreme weather (such as flash floods and heatwaves), changing lengths of seasons, and changing crop yields.
