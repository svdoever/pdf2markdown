Scientists believe that oceans are acidifying faster today than at any time in the last 300 million years.

## Warmer oceans
Climate change is also having a big impact on the world’s oceans. Oceans have absorbed more than 90% of the additional heat from atmospheric changes caused by our activities over the past 40 years. While this means that the atmosphere is not warming as much as it could, it is warming the oceans. Species like fish, shrimp, whales, and plankton (tiny organisms eaten by fish) respond to the warmer water by migrating towards the poles where it is cooler. However, tiny shrimp-like krill, eaten by fish and whales, breed best in cold water. Warmer water means fewer krill and fewer fish. Coral reefs, which are home to over 25% of all marine life and where many fish breed, also struggle to survive when the water gets too warm.

The oceans absorb around a quarter of the carbon dioxide we release every year, and rising levels of CO2 mean greater amounts of the gas being stored in the seas. This helps to regulate the climate but is changing the chemical balance in the oceans. The waters are becoming more acidic, which is harmful to marine life, in particular to shell-building sea creatures like lobsters, oysters, and corals. This is of particular concern as they are at the beginning of the food chain for a number of species.

Oceans absorb about 4 kg of CO₂ per person per day.

Can you imagine what it is like to know that one day your home may be submerged by water? The Marshall Islands in the northern Pacific Ocean is one of the most vulnerable island countries in the world, with much of the land lying only around a few metres above sea level. Scientists say a local rise in sea level of just 80 cm could submerge two-thirds of the land.

## Rising sea levels
Between 1901 and 2010, the average sea level across the world rose by 19 cm. There are two main reasons for this: the first is that as water gets warmer it expands and takes up more space. The second is that global warming is causing glaciers and the giant ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica to melt faster, adding more water to the oceans. The resulting rise in sea levels causes floods on low-lying coastlines and is threatening to submerge some islands completely. Higher sea levels can also harm important coastal ecosystems like mangrove forests, which are safe havens for young fish and other wildlife, protecting them from storms that erode coasts. And when salt water soaks into land, it ruins drinking water supplies and spoils soils, making it impossible to grow crops.
