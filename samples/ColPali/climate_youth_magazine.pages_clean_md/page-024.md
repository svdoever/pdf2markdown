## Forests: our climate protectors

Forests play a unique role in climate change. On one hand, they release greenhouse gases when trees are cut down or decay or when the soil underneath is disturbed, contributing to global warming. On the other hand, forests capture greenhouse gases through photosynthesis and they also help to cool the planet. This makes them crucial in the fight against climate change.

### How can we ensure forests have a positive effect?

Sustainable management of forests, whereby new trees are planted to replace old ones or those that have been cut down, can be an effective solution. EU countries are working together to improve the role of forests in EU action against climate change.

### Deforestation Facts

Humans are cutting down the world's forests at an alarming rate: up to 80% of tropical deforestation is done to clear land for farms, but trees are also being cut down to make products such as timber and paper or to build roads and mines. As well as speeding up climate change, deforestation destroys the habitats of forest animals and changes rainfall patterns, causing droughts.

An area of tropical forest about the same size as Greece is cut down every year.
