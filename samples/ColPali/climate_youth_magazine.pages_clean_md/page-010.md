## A changing world

The effects of climate change are being felt on all continents and are predicted to become more frequent and intense in the coming decades. Different countries and regions face different problems. These changes have the power to transform our world, affecting food and water supplies and our health. The bigger the problems, the more difficult and expensive it will be to solve them – which is why taking early action to deal with climate change is the best option.

### Feeling the heat

The world is experiencing more hot days and fewer cold days, with heatwaves predicted to become more frequent and last longer. Long periods of unusually hot weather can be dangerous, causing health problems such as heatstroke and even death. A warmer planet can also lead to water shortages and droughts. This is already being experienced in Europe, particularly in southern parts. A lack of rain means trees and other plants become very dry and can catch fire easily, resulting in destructive wildfires.

### Food for thought

Searing heat and a lack of water are a disastrous mix for crops and world food supplies. Plants need water to survive and, without plants to eat, livestock such as cattle starve too. When the top layer of soil in a farmer’s field dries out, it becomes dusty and blows away, taking with it vital nutrients the plants need. The result is less food, which is a significant problem because the world’s population is set to increase from around 7.5 billion today to 9 billion by 2050 – so we will need more food, not less.

Our food supplies are also threatened by the negative effects of climate change on bees and other pollinators. All of this means that we need to prevent climate change as much as we can, while adapting our agriculture to deal with a changing climate.

The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation estimates that of the 100 or so types of crops that provide 90% of food worldwide, 71 are pollinated by bees!
