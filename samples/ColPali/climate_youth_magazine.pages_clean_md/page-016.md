## Making a difference

The most important challenge we face today is to stop climate change getting worse. There is a lot we can – and must – do to make our world less energy-consuming and more climate-friendly. This means finding solutions that help us cut greenhouse gas emissions. As well as being good for the planet, it is also good for our health (less pollution), the security of our energy supplies and the economy, as it creates new jobs.

### Renewable energy

One way to cut greenhouse gas emissions is by using more renewable energy, such as wind and solar power. These provide endless supplies of energy, unlike fossil fuels which will run out one day. And unlike burning fossil fuels in power stations, generating electricity from renewables produces little to no greenhouse gases.

The EU is a world leader in renewable energy technologies, and many EU countries are already generating a lot of their electricity from renewables. Getting more of our energy from renewable sources not only cuts emissions but also means spending less on coal, oil and gas imports from outside the EU. In 2015, nearly 17% of the EU’s energy came from renewables. The plan is to raise this to 20% by 2020 and at least 27% by 2030.

### Reduce subsidies to fossil fuels

There is considerable public financial support for the production and use of fossil fuels, which receive almost twice as many subsidies as renewables. Renewable energy would be even more competitive if fossil fuels received less support.

### New ideas on the horizon

Finding sustainable solutions to tackle climate change requires new scientific research and discoveries. Horizon 2020, the EU’s biggest ever research and innovation programme, has nearly €680 billion of funding available between 2014 and 2020 to help researchers and innovators develop ideas that could be applied in the real world. A large chunk of the funds (at least 35%) will be spent on climate-related projects. The EU is also supporting the development of innovative low-carbon power plants.

EU countries are working hard to cut greenhouse gas emissions, to help the EU meet its overall reduction targets: -20% by 2020 and -40% by 2030 compared to 1990, with a long-term goal of at least -80% by 2050.
