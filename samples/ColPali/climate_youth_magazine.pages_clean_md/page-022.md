## Cleaner industries

Factories that make the products we use and power stations that produce the electricity we need to power our homes, schools and offices release CO₂ and other greenhouse gases (GHGs). To reduce these emissions, the EU created the world’s first and biggest system to limit the amount of GHGs that can be emitted and make companies pay for the emissions they release into the atmosphere.

The EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) was launched in 2005 and is a key part of the EU’s climate policy. It covers over 11,000 power stations and factories – and also includes emissions from flights within the EU.

The system limits the annual amount of GHGs that European companies can emit. This limit goes down every year and, because companies must report their emissions, we can be sure that the system is reducing pollution. The more GHGs companies emit, the more they have to pay, so it is in their interest to emit as little as possible – for example by investing in cleaner technologies which produce less CO₂.

Today, similar systems are being set up around the world, for example in China, South Korea and California.

For sectors that are not covered by the EU Emission Trading System, like road transport, construction, agriculture and waste, GHG emissions must still be reduced, as all EU countries have a national target for cutting emissions in these sectors.

## Supporting new technology

The EU is helping to develop innovative low-carbon technologies through a special fund raised through the EU Emissions Trading System. A total €2.1 billion has been allocated to support 38 projects across Europe. Some of the projects are focused on renewable energy, such as offshore wind turbines, geothermal energy and biofuels, others on new technology that captures carbon and stores it underground.

The EU and its Member States will continue to support research and development for low-carbon innovations through the Innovation Fund and EU research Framework Programme. The key objective is to turn low-carbon ideas into practical solutions in many areas of our life.

## Storing carbon underground

Carbon capture and storage is a technique which traps carbon dioxide emitted by power plants and industrial factories, compresses it and then transports it to a suitable storage site deep under the ground. This has significant potential to help the fight against climate change in Europe and around the world: underground sites can store virtually all of the carbon dioxide for hundreds, even thousands of years. However, the technology is currently very expensive and there are only two commercial projects operating in Europe. Therefore, the EU is providing seed funding to support carbon capture and storage projects and has created rules to ensure the technique is used in an environmentally-friendly way.
