## Changing with the climate

Whether we like it or not, climate change is a part of our lives. Even if we could eliminate all our emissions tomorrow, the planet would still have to recover from the greenhouse gases that are already in the atmosphere. This means we need to adapt to the changes happening now and plan for the future to prevent or limit the damage that climate change can cause.

## Adapting to rising waters

### Floating houses
In Maasbommel, in the low-lying Netherlands, some residents are preparing for more frequent floods by living in amphibious homes that are anchored to the land but designed to rise when the water rises.

### Building barriers
Constructing manmade sea walls and dykes helps keep the water out, as do sand dunes. These can be planted with tough grasses whose roots help stop the dunes being washed away.

### Green sponges
Flood plains (natural areas that drain into rivers) can act as sponges, absorbing excess rainwater. Countries along the Danube and Elbe rivers are restoring former plains by giving rivers more room.

## Water wise

### Water conservation
Some people are finding novel ways to save water, for example by installing ‘grey-water’ systems in homes and businesses (such as hotels) that reuse water from washing to flush toilets. And innovative farmers are using trickle irrigation at night so that plants get water straight to their roots without evaporating in the heat of the day.
