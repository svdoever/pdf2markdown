## Sustainable shopping

In 2016, the city of Modena in Italy teamed up with environmental technology consultants to renovate a large supermarket, under an EU-funded project to modernise the area and make it more environmentally sustainable. Thanks to innovative solutions such as solar tubes that channel direct sunlight into the supermarket, the building now uses much less energy and has lower operating costs.

## Solar cycle path

In 2014, an unusual cycle path was built in the Netherlands: one that generates solar power. The 72-metre path in Krommenie, near Amsterdam, has built-in solar cells that convert sunlight into electricity. In the first year, more than 300,000 cyclists rode along this trial cycle path, which generated enough electricity to power three homes for a year!

## Hot spot

Geothermal energy is hot stuff! Some countries can use energy stored below the Earthâ€™s surface to warm pipes that heat homes and water, or to drive a generator to produce electricity. Many spas in Hungary use geothermal energy to heat water for leisure activities, and the EU is supporting innovative geothermal power projects there, too.
