## ERIK – 11 – Danish/Spanish

### What needs to be done to combat climate change?
We need to stop cutting down trees and start replanting them. Not only in the Amazon but also in Europe and Asia, Africa – everywhere. Because trees give us oxygen.

### What are you doing to fight climate change?
I don’t turn on the light if I don’t need to. Saving water is also very important, so I take showers instead of baths. I try to use as little energy as possible. One person doesn’t change anything, but if everyone contributes, we can change everything together.

### How is climate change affecting our planet?
Temperatures are changing very rapidly, and now the four seasons are blending. Summer, winter, spring and autumn are all mixed up. We never know what the temperature will be, and there are a number of terrible floods, disasters and droughts.

### What are you doing to fight climate change?
I personally walk to school every day, and I try to go by car as little as possible. I travel on foot, by tram, and so on. I also separate my waste, such as plastic and paper, for recycling. In my opinion, if everyone did this, the situation would change and improve.

I have a responsibility, or rather, I feel that it is my duty to react now, and do something to ensure I can live my life in the future.

### What needs to be done to combat climate change?
There are minor things that everyone can do. However, the major things, the important decisions, have to be made on a political level, and that’s not up to us. Rather, it is up to us, because we vote for the politicians. We have to vote for those who will change the current situation.
