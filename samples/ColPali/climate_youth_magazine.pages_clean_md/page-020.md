## Save energy, save money

More efficient buildings and appliances can save huge amounts of energy, emissions and money. A large amount of energy used by households in the EU goes on heating homes. Triple-glazed windows, good insulation, and roofs covered with plants that help to keep buildings cool are just some of the ways to reduce the carbon footprint of our homes, schools and offices. More efficient appliances, like refrigerators and washing machines, are expected to save European households around â‚¬465 a year on their energy bills by 2020.

### Did you know?
By the end of 2020, all new buildings in the EU will have to be nearly zero-energy buildings.

## European Green Capitals

The European Green Capital award is given to cities that are committed to becoming more sustainable. Essen in Germany took the honours for 2017, while Nijmegen in the Netherlands holds the title in 2018. The aim is to reward cities that have been achieving high environmental standards in the long-term, to encourage cities to commit to ambitious goals and to motivate other cities by creating a space for cities to inspire each other to share ideas and experiences.

### Sustainable
able to ensure we have and continue to have the basic resources needed to survive, such as water, food and energy. Living sustainably means taking care of the planet and living within the limits of what it can provide.
