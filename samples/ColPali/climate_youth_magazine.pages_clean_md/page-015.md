## Tackling the heat

### Smart planting
Some farmers are planting more crops among trees for shade to cope with the hotter, drier climate. In cities, landscapers are introducing drought-tolerant flowers and shrubs in parks and along roadsides that can cope with warm, dry conditions.

### Green walls and roofs
A number of cities are growing plants on walls and roofs to absorb heat and help control the temperature inside buildings when it is hot. They also absorb water and reduce run-off during storms. In some countries, such as France and Denmark, the law requires all new buildings to have green roofs.

## Plans to tackle climate change
Many EU countries have already prepared national plans to address the impacts of climate change. As different regions will face different problems, these plans have to be adapted to regional and local situations. In agricultural areas, for example, this might include investing in storage facilities to water crops in a drought, while in cities it may mean creating more parks to keep people cool during heatwaves.

## Preparing for extreme weather in Copenhagen
In July 2011, it rained in Copenhagen... but this was no ordinary shower. Around 15 cm of rain fell in just 2 hours. The city's drains could not cope with the volume of water and buildings and roads were soon flooded. Two of Copenhagen's major hospitals were threatened with closure because of flooding and power cuts. The event made the city's leaders think about drawing up a plan to protect the city from future extreme weather events.

As a result, a 'Cloudburst Management Plan' was developed which not only helps manage rainwater better but is also improving the quality of city life. The scheme even includes new bicycle routes that also serve as storm-water channels.
