Climate change is one of the most serious challenges facing our world today. Our planet is experiencing significant and accelerated climate change that began over a century ago.

Most scientists agree that the planet is warming up faster than ever because of the vast amount of greenhouse gases that humans are pumping into the atmosphere. This includes activities such as burning fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas), driving cars and cutting down forests.

Many of us have seen – and even experienced – the effects of climate change. But it is not just about extreme weather like floods, droughts and hurricanes. Slower and less noticeable changes in our climate have the potential to completely alter the way we live.

The good news is that in Paris in December 2015, 195 countries agreed to the first ever legally-binding global deal to tackle climate change. In the EU and around the world, governments, companies and individuals are already working to tackle its causes and adapt to the changes it brings. We all have a part to play because climate change is a global problem which can affect each one of us.

We all share one planet and the changes we make in one place can affect others far away. Through our actions and choices, each one of us can take steps to leave smaller footprints and help tackle climate change.
