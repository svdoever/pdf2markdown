## 100% renewable energy by 2030?

In Sweden's Kalmar county, local authorities and energy companies are working together to try to make the area totally fossil fuel-free by 2030. Doing this will also ensure sustainable development and create jobs. Actions include buses that run on 100% renewable energy, car-sharing initiatives (some already using electric cars), producing fuel from food waste and getting energy from solar and wind farms.

## Concrete action on CO₂ emissions

Concrete is essential for making buildings, roads and bridges but producing its basic ingredient, cement, also generates large amounts of CO₂. Making one tonne of cement releases one tonne of CO₂, as most cement is made by heating limestone to high temperatures. The cement industry is now starting to make more sustainable concrete by investing in modern technology and using material that emits less CO₂.

## Jobs in the pipeline

Fancy an exciting career working with the latest cutting-edge technologies? Today, there are many jobs in areas like renewables that did not exist 10 years ago. Some EU countries have even set up special training centres for the operation and maintenance of offshore wind turbines. Imagine climbing up an 85 m tall wind turbine tower to fix an electrical fault or service the oil filter – a long way from the shore and working in stormy seas and gusting winds!
