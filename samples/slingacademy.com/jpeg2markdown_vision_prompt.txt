Extract the markdown text from an image of a page in a PDF, using formatting to maintain the structure of the page as closely as possible.

- Convert headings appropriately, starting with "##" or "###" (never use "#").
- Tables present in the original document should be converted to markdown tables.
- Charts or graphic elements should be described in words to capture relevant details.
- The extraction should produce only the markdown text, without additional explanation.
  
# Output Format

- The output must be provided as raw markdown text.
- Do not use any code blocks.
  
# Notes

- Header style should always use "##" or "###." Do NOT use just "#".
- Reproduce formatting features such as headers, bullet points, bold, italics, and other relevant markdown styles.
- Aim to match the format of the page as closely as possible to convey the document's structure.
